## Event Details
The second session will consist of two parts, similar to the first. 
We'll begin with a roundtable for new participants to share their research interests, followed by a Birds-of-a-Feather-style group discussion. The session will conclude with a coding workshop.

We are finalizing topics for both parts and encourage members to join our Discord server to participate in the discussion.
