## Event Details
The second session will again consist of two parts—just like the first one! 🤓  
We’ll start with a roundtable where new participants can share their research interests, areas of expertise, and the NLP subtopics they’re passionate about. Then, we'll transition into a Birds-of-a-Feather-style session for lively group discussions.

The second part of the session will feature a coding workshop. 🖥️

We’re currently selecting topics for both parts, and we encourage you to join our Discord server to weigh in on the discussion. To receive a link to our Discord server, please fill out the form on the home page (if you haven’t already). 🚀
