## Event Details
The second session will again consist of two parts—just like the first one!  
We’ll start with a roundtable where new participants can share their research interests. 
Then, we'll transition into a Birds-of-a-Feather-style session for group discussions.
The second part of the session will feature a coding workshop. 

We’re currently selecting topics for both parts, and we encourage you to join our Discord server to weigh in on the discussion.
