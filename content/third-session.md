## Event Details
The third session will consist of one part. 
We'll begin with a roundtable for new participants to share their research interests, followed by a Birds-of-a-Feather-style group discussion.
The idea is to discuss recent papers and experience in the selected topics.  
We are finalizing topics and encourage members to join our Discord server to participate in the discussion. 
To receive the Discord link, please fill out the form on the homepage (if you haven't already).

You can also select your preferred topics in the registration form below.
